                <p class="paragraph">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About
                    twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The
                    locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of
                    animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then
                    deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular
                    direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which
                    no dam could contain.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas
                    Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited
                    philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                    Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                    revolvers upon them.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a
                    procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg
                    foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the
                    locomotive
                    into this herd of beasts!"

                The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.
